# War of the Ring Logfile Annotator

Annotates your War of the Ring Java logfiles with your password!
And maybe the password of your opponent, if you ask them nicely.

## Recommended Usage

1. Open the annotator when you start a game on the WotR Java client.
2. When you view your hand in the Java client, also write your password in the proper field in the annotator.
   **DO NOT CLOSE IT**, just leave it open in the background while you play!
3. When you are done with your game, save your logfile as usual.
4. (Optional) Get your opponent's password and fill it in in the appropriate field of this annotator.
5. Select the logfile in the annotator, then press confirm.

Now your log will be annotated with the passwords! You can see them when you watch the replay. As a safety measure, the passwords will only appear in the replay after both players have viewed their hands, so you may need to skip forward a bit before you can enter them.
